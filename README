===============================
Run Web Service (on Windows PC)
===============================

1. Clone this repository to local disk, or download as a ZIP and then unzip it on local disk.
2. Install Java 8 SDK, e.g. the latest one "jdk-8u152-windows-x64.exe" as of today; 
   set JAVA_HOME to JDK installation directory, e.g. JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_152
3. Open a command prompt, go the project directory ~\Fibonacci\, run command: activator run
   NOTE: make sure the network is not blocked by any firewalls, otherwise it's possible to meet build failures.
   The web service should be up and running (at port 9000 by default) after successful compliation. 

4. Use Browser or Postman to send requests. Two forms are supported.

(a) get <amount> (e.g. 10) fibonacci numbers with a simple list

GET http://localhost:9000/api/1/fibonacci/numbers?amount=10

return: [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34]

(b) get <amount> (e.g. 20) fibonacci numbers with pagination support

GET http://localhost:9000/api/1/fibonacci/numbers?amount=20&offset=2&limit=4

return:

{
	"amount":20,
	"numbers":[1,2,3,5],
	"previous":"http://localhost:9000/api/1/fibonacci/numbers?amount=20&offset=0&limit=4",
	"next":"http://localhost:9000/api/1/fibonacci/numbers?amount=20&offset=6&limit=4"
}


===============================
Test Automation for Web Service
===============================

1. Make sure the web service is up and running by following above instructions.
2. Open another command prompt, go the project directory ~\Fibonacci\, run command: activator test
   The automated test cases should be completed successfully.
